# Movie Service
This project was created with 2 colleagues as a part of ZPI (Team IT venture) which was also a basis for my Bachelor's thesis. The main purpose of the project is to be a user-oriented movie service with the functionalities such as browsing the lists of movies/series/people if cinema, submitting requests to add previously not present ones, submitting reviews or adding to the "watch later" list. Service allows users to log in through third party identity providers such as Google or Facebook and autofill the requests with data scraped from different similar sites such as filmweb/imdb. My main input to the project was to implement the functionalities that user can use (as opposed to the super user - admin and omitting the data scraping - these were mostly created by the colleagues). This repo consists of 2 previously separate repositories: pwr_zpi_backend utilizing Django and Django REST framework with MySQL and pwr_zpi_frontent with Vue.js and Vuetify.
An early verion of the app was deployed in the link provided in the description, but it is not maintained nor working properly, so just left it as a remaining.
